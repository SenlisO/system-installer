List of Planned Features
 - Quick-install config file 
   - User provides properly formatted config file that allows installation to proceed immediately
   - Most of the code is there. Just needs testing and debugging
 - Modularity
   - Should make it so that `system-installer` is usable on more distros and is far more flexible.
